A highly driven Junior Software Developer that is fascinated by anything tech-related - from video games to AI, from self-driving cars to simple web-apps! This passion for technology stems from my belief in the power of software, and its ability to change the world and how we live. 

Directly after graduating with a degree in Mathematical, Statistical, and Actuarial Sciences, I started working as a Graduate Analyst in an Insurance Company. I realized very quickly that I was in the wrong career path and that is mainly what inspired my change of career. I wanted to combine both my love for technology and problem-solving and coding ticks both of those boxes! 

I joined [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) in June 2019 and it has been instrumental in my growth as a developer. I have learnt the fundamentals of software development through a multitude of projects and gathered valuable experience that will help me in my pursuit of my dream developer role.

## Skills (To be completed)

#### Analytical Thinker

During my undergraduate degree in a Mathematical field, analysis and problem-solving skills was essentially needed everyday in order to keep up with the curriculum that has subjects like Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. It was tough but I managed to finish the course with honours.

#### Teamplayer

From shooting hoops with my basketball teammates, to debugging code with my pair-programming partners at Makers Academy, I have always put the utmost importance on communication and compromise when working in a team. I have learned that things are done with speed and finesse when everyone is happy with who they are working with. I have never failed to bring enthusiasm and hard work whenever I collaborate with others.
